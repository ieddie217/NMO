        Concluding Thoughts and Comments
      </h1>
      <h5>
        Since the majority of programs that are related to mathematical computations are written using MATLAB, I wanted to try something different and see how difficult it is 
        to write mathematical algorithms and programs in another programming language. 
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The first set of difficulties I observed when attempting to write my programs was in how JavaScript dealt with float point number precision.
      </h5>
      <h5> Floating point arithmetic 
        is not always 100% accurate in JavaScript. For an example, in JavaScript, \(0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004\), as opposed to  0.3 that is computed in most other programming languages
       such as MATLAB. 
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Therefore, I occassionally had to do extra multiplication and divisions steps to get the correct solution. For the previous example, I would have to multiple and divide by 10 so that \(\frac{(0.2 \cdot 10 + 0.1 \cdot 10)}{10} = 0.3\)
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Another problem was the lack of mathematical tools available like in MATLAB. 
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The built in Math package is very simple and does not provide functions to solve more complex math, such as calculating the inverse of a matrix, or solving a system
        of linear equations.
      </h5>
      <h5>
      Instead, I had to either write these functions myself, or use 3rd party JavaScript libraries.
      </h5>
      <h5 class='mb-3'>
        If I could redo the project again, I would choose to use another programming language for the back-end handling of the website, most likely Python, to avoid dealing with
        the inaccurate floating point precision problems.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        I hope that this website will serve to establish a better understanding of the material for students.
