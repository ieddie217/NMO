        Trust-Region Algorithms
      </h1>
      <h5>
          An alternative to line search algorithms are trust region algorithms. Using the information gathered about an objective function, \(f\), a model function, \(m_k\),
          is constructed which behaves very similarly to \(f\) near the point, \(x_k\).
      </h5>
      <h5>
          We first find the candidate step, \(p\), by solving:
      </h5>
      <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>
        <h5 class='mx-auto'>     min \(m_k(x_k +p)\), &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp where \(x_k + p\) is inside the trust region </h5>
    </div>
    <h5>
        The trust region is usually defined as a ball where \(||p||_2 \leq \Delta_k\)
    </h5>
      <h5>
          The model function, \(m_k\) is usually defined to be a quadratic of the form
      </h5>
        <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>
          <h5 class='mx-auto'>     \(m_k(x_k +p) = f_k + p^T \nabla f_k + \frac{1}{2} p^TB_kp     \hspace{2cm} (*) \)</h5>
      </div>
      <h5>
          where \(f_k\) is a scalar, \(\nabla f_k \) is a vector, and \(B_k\) is either the Hessian matrix or an approximation of it.
      </h5>
      <!-- <h5>
        One of the key components of the trust-region algorithm is the choice of the trust-region radius, \(\Delta_k\) at each iteration.
      </h5>  -->
      <h5>
        Given a step \(p_k\) we then define 
      </h5>
      <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>
        <h5 class='mx-auto'>    \(\rho_k = \frac{f(x_k) - f(x_k+p_k)}{m_k(0) - m_k(p_k)}\)</h5>
    </div>
    <h5 class='mb-4'>
      The general algorithm for Trust Region methods, which can be found as Algorithm 4.1 in the Nocedal and Wright Textbook, is:

      Cauchy Point 
    </h3>
    <h5>
      There are many ways that we can solve \((*)\) for \(p_k\). One of them is done by solving for the Cauchy Point 
    </h5>
    <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>

  <h5 class='mb-5'>where \(\tau_k = 1\) if \(\nabla f_k^T B_k \nabla f_k \leq 0 \), otherwise \(\tau_k = min(\frac{||\nabla f_k||^3}{\Delta_k \nabla f_k^T B_k \nabla f_k},1) \)</h5>

    Branin Function
  </h3>
  <h5>
    Let us use the trust-region method to solve the Branin Function, where the trust-region subproblems are solved via the Cauchy point.
  </h5>
  <h5>
    The Branin Function is defined by:
  </h5>
  <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>
    <h5 class='mx-auto'>       \(f(x,y) = (y - 0.129x^2 + 1.6x - 6) ^2 + 6.07cos(x) + 10\)</h5>
  </div>
  <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>

    <h5 class='mx-auto'>       \(\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix}
      (2 (1.61 - 0.258 x) (-0.129 x^2 + 1.61 x + y - 6) - 6.07 sin(x)\\ 2 (-0.129 x^2 + 1.61 x + y - 6))
      \end{bmatrix}\)</h5>
    </div>
  <div class='d-flex justify-content-center mb-3'>
    
      <h5 class='mx-auto'>       \(\nabla^2 f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix}
        (2 (1.61 - 0.258 x)^2 - 0.516 (-0.129 x^2 + 1.61 x + y - 6) - 6.07 cos(x) & 2 (1.61 - 0.258 x)\\
        2 (1.61 - 0.258 x) & 2
        \end{bmatrix}\)</h5>
  </div>
  <h5>
    The contour map of the function is provided below.
  </h5>

  </div>
  <h5>
    Let us set our starting values to \(x_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 14\end{bmatrix}, \Delta_0 = 2.0, \Delta_M = 5.0, \eta = 0.2\)
  </h5>
  <h5>
    Using the Cauchy point calculation, we compute \(p_k =\begin{bmatrix} -0.2522739904 \\-1.98402566\end{bmatrix} \)
  </h5>
  <h5>
    Then we evaluate \(\rho_k\) to be \(0.999214320051559\), and therefore \(\Delta_{1} = 4.0\)
  </h5>
  <h5>
    Finally, since \(\rho_k > \eta\), then \(x_{1} = x_0 + p_k = \begin{bmatrix}5.7477260\\12.0159743\end{bmatrix} \).
  </h5>
  <h5 class='mb-5'> 
    Repeating this process, we get the table of values below where the minimum occurs at approximately \(x = \begin{bmatrix}3.138 \\ 2.252 \end{bmatrix}\)

      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div> 
  <h5> The program for this is located in the trustregion.js file.</h5>
  <h5>
    Plotting these iteration values onto the contour map, we can see how the Trust Region with Cauchy point algorithm works.

    Conclusion: Trust Region vs. Line Search
  </h3>
  <h5>
      Comparing the two different types of algorithms, line-search algorithms are objectively more simple to understand as it only requires two variables. </h5>
      <h5>In line-search algorithms,
      we first pick the search direction, \(p_k\), then compute the step length, \(\alpha_k\), and update \(x_k\). </h5>
      <h5>Comparatively, trust region algorithms require more work and computations.</h5>
      <h5>
      For trust region methods, we first pick the step size and solve the trust region sub-problem using the approximated model. If the change is acceptable, we then update \(x_k\) as well 
      as the trust region itself. 
      </h5>
      <h5>
        From the different methods for line search algorithms, although steepest descent is simplest and easy to apply, it is often not idea as it will take too long to reach
        the solution. Newton's method offers a more practical solution.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        For trust region methods, using the Cauchy point to solve the trust region subproblem is comparable to Newton's method, as both are much more efficient than Steepest Descent. 
        The main problem with Newton's and Cauchy's, is that both require computation of the Hessian matrix or an approximation to it, which can often be expensive to compute.
